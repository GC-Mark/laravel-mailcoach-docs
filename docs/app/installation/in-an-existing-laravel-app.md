title: Installation into an existing Laravel app
---

If you already have a Laravel 8 application, you can install Mailcoach as a package inside it. You'll get a beautiful UI for administering email lists and campaigns. Additionally, installing it as a package offers some great ways of customizing Mailcoach. Anything that can be done via the Mailcoach UI, can also be done via code. 

Head over to the [package installation instructions](/docs/v3/package/general/installation-and-setup) to continue. Make sure to [check the requirements](/docs/v3/package/general/requirements) first.
