In order to use Mailcoach, you must buy a license. To buy a license you must [register](/register) first. If you already have an account you can log in [here](/login) to view your existing licenses.

Single domain licenses are valid for the installation of Mailcoach on a single domain or subdomain. In case you bought the SaaS license, there are no restrictions. A licence comes with one year of upgrades. If a license expires, you are still allowed to use Mailcoach, but you won't get any updates anymore.
